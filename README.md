# CH.js, the JavaScript Framework used to simplify standard behaviors
================================================================

**CH.js** is a tool developed on small and large projects to simplify website standard behaviors. We always need to implement slideshow, scroll bars, modals or calendars on our website. This tool give a basic definition that can be extended with your specific needs. Some of mine are included...

It also include standard libraries implementation (loading, initialization, simplified API) like [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) or social plugins like [Facebook](http://developes.facebook.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com), [Google+](http://plus.google.com), [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com).

It can be used with the framework of your choice (MooTools, jQuery, Prototype) and components can be built with all externals libraries that you need.

The dependency system allow (like all known AMD tools) to define and require all needed object before starting coding.
